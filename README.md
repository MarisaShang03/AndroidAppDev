# AndroidAppDev
I am creating an Android Mobile App while learning Android development.

Week 1 Add buttons and textview, and adjust layout. Use toast to display messages
Week 3 Add new activity, Add 6 buttons and display them in constraint layout; Handle display rotation
Week 4 Add Link Collector that brings up a new activity. 
       Add floating action button. Add RecyclerView to display a list of items in the app 
       Make sure the list display well when app display is rotated
       Use snackbar to display message
Week 5 Use location service. Display latitude and longitude.
       Ask user's permission when using the location service
Week 6 Use a web API. Send a request to and get a response from the web service.
       I used a weather API. User can enter a zip code. The app displays the weather, temperature, UV level, 
       city name, state of the zip code.
