My app asks users to enter a valid zip code, and return the temperature, ultraviolet level (UV level), city name, and state of the place entered.
If the zip code is not valid, I will show an error message.

I used a progress bar (a spinning circle) to show the web service connection is in process. But because the connection is very quick, the process bar
only shows up for a few second.
